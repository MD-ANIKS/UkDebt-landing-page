                  <p>A Debt Management Plan (DMP) offers a structured yet adaptable approach to handle your debts and
                    regain financial stability.</p>
                  <p>It is an informal agreement between you and your creditors to pay back your debts over time. It is
                    managed by a DMP provider, who works with you to organise a payment schedule based on your income
                    and expenses.</p>
                  <p>With a DMP, a budget is tailored to your needs, encompassing crucial household expenditures like
                    rent, mortgage, utility bills, and grocery shopping. The surplus income after these essential costs,
                    known as your ‘disposable income,’ is utilised to repay your creditors.</p>
                  <p>The length of time a DMP varies based on the total debt and monthly payment amounts; it can last
                    several years.</p>
                  <strong>Alternative Debt Solutions might be suitable for you</strong>
                  <p>While a Debt Management Plan (DMP) could be a viable option to tackle your debt issues, it’s
                    important to explore and assess other available debt solutions before you commit to a DMP. It’s
                    advisable to thoroughly investigate all potential alternatives to ensure the choice you make is the
                    best fit for your financial situation. For further details, please complete the form above.</p>

                  <div>
                    <p>An Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) is a structured debt solution that enables you to
                      “freeze” your debts and establish an agreement to repay them over a fixed term, typically spanning
                      5-6 years. Any debt remaining after this period is forgiven.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <p>An IVA represents a formal, legally binding agreement between you and your unsecured creditors.
                      It
                      is set up and monitored by a certified Insolvency Practitioner (IP). Essentially, you commit to
                      repaying as much as you can afford over the agreed term, and at the end of this period, your
                      creditors consent to write off any outstanding balances.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <p>Our role is to help you determine an affordable monthly payment amount and evaluate if you have
                      additional resources to enhance the agreement, such as proceeds from asset sales, remortgaging, or
                      savings.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <p>The fees associated with an IVA are established in agreement with your creditors. These fees are
                      deducted from the payments you make into the arrangement after it is approved, ensuring there are
                      no
                      additional costs for you.</p>
                  </div>
                  <strong>Alternative Debt Solutions might be suitable for you</strong>
                  <div>
                    <p>While a Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA) could be a viable option to tackle your debt
                      issues,
                      it’s important to explore and assess other available debt solutions before you commit to a IVA.
                      It’s
                      advisable to thoroughly investigate all potential alternatives to ensure the choice you make is
                      the
                      best fit for your financial situation. For further details, please complete the form above.</p>

                    <p>The fees outlined within your IVA proposal will be £3,650 for a 5-year term. This is subject to
                      change if the term is extended for any reason or if further monies are introduced into the IVA
                      (such as from the sale of an asset) but these will be detailed within your documents. Your
                      creditors may choose to modify these fees before acceptance of the IVA, usually, so they get a
                      better return, these will be discussed with you for your agreement before the IVA can be accepted.

                  <p>A supervisor’s fee is also included within the fee proposed to your creditors. Should additional

                    <br>

                    The supervisor’s fee covers the expenses incurred while implementing your IVA for its duration. This
                    includes the cost of collecting your monthly payment and distributing it to creditors, handling any
                    queries from yourself or creditors, managing creditor relations, undertaking annual reviews, and any
                    other work involved in implementing your IVA.

                    will be included in this fee, however, if the fees are modified by your creditors these may be due
                    on top of your Nominee & Supervisors fees. Just remember, these will all be covered by your monthly

                  <p>Bankruptcy is the most known form of insolvency. Bankruptcy helps you deal with debts you cannot
                    afford to pay off within a reasonable period. It is a legal process through which you can write
                    off the debts you have been unable to pay and may involve selling off certain assets (your
                    belongings and property).</p>
                  <p>An average bankruptcy in the UK lasts 1 year but it can last longer, depending on your
                    circumstances. You may be required to make payments into your Bankruptcy for up to three years.
                  </p>
                  <p>You can only declare Bankruptcy if you are living in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Those
                    residing in Scotland can apply for sequestration, which is the Scottish equivalent of Bankruptcy.

                  <strong>Alternative Debt Solutions might be suitable for you</strong>
                  <p>While a bankruptcy could be a viable option to tackle your debt issues, it’s important to explore
                    and assess other available debt solutions before you commit to bankruptcy. It’s advisable to
                    thoroughly investigate all potential alternatives to ensure the choice you make is the best fit for
                    your financial situation. For further details, please complete the form above.</p>

                  <p>Debt Relief Orders (DROs) are officially recognized debt solutions intended for individuals with

                  <p>Should you not own a home, possess limited disposable income, and have debts under £30,000, a Debt
                    Relief Order (DRO) might offer a viable approach to managing your financial obligations.</p>
                  <p>As an alternative to Bankruptcy or an Individual Voluntary Arrangement, DROs are accessible to
                    those living in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland.</p>
                  <strong>Alternative Debt Solutions might be suitable for you</strong>
                  <p>While a Debt Relief Order (DRO) bankruptcy could be a viable option to tackle your debt issues,
                    it’s important to explore and assess other available debt solutions before you commit to DRO. It’s
                    advisable to thoroughly investigate all potential alternatives to ensure the choice you make is the
                    best fit for your financial situation. For further details, please complete the form above.</p>
